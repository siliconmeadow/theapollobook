# Getting Started
In its simplest configuration, you can run a single vagrant node Apollo cluster on your own machine. Of course, if you have more resources on your computer you can also run a mulitiple node cluster on your machine. Those so inclined can use other cloud based services such as AWS, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, etc.

This chapter is divided into sections for local vagrant development (good for starting if you don't have a cloud provider or if you want to mimic a similar environment for your application), AWS development and Digital Ocean. Choose a section and get started. Upon completion, you can tear down the environment to ensure you don't incur any more cost than is necessary.
